# My Flask App

This is a flask app. I decided to build this project so I can more learn more about python and flask. It's an article app based on a course from Traversy media (https://youtu.be/zRwy8gtgJ1A) where the user can register and log in and set articles each one with its title and content. Everything is saved in a MySQL database.
